Everyone: VGMUSIC
-----------------

These programs function as:
* MIDI Sequencer
* Virtual Piano

These were used by the band Everyone for live performances from the years 1999-2003.  Each song or medley of songs that the band performed had a separate program.

They were compiled with Borland Turbo C++ and run on MS-DOS.

The programs sent MIDI messages out of the joystick port of the Sound Blaster card to an Alesis QS 6 and also a device to control lighting rigs by MIDI messages.

They are provided as is for archival purposes.
